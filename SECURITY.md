## Process

I'll be in touch with you asap and try to reproduce the issue.

If the issue can be confirmed, a fix will be created and applied to my software which is still under maintenance.

I'll update you during the process and once the fix has been applied.

It will be made publicly announced and further steps will be taken depending on the severity after the release of the fix.

## Bug Bounty Program

I do not take part on any BB program at the moment.
