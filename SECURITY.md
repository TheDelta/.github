# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact me via E-Mail security@dolphbit.de for any vulnerabilities or security concerns.

## Process

I'll be in touch with you asap and try to reproduce the issue.

If the issue can be confirmed, a fix will be created and applied.

I'll update you during the process and once the fix has been applied, it will be made publicly announced and further steps will be taken depending on the severity.

## Bug Bounty Program

I do not take part on any BB program at the moment.
